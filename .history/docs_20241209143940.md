## CJS or ESM ??

The difference between require() and import in Node.js lies in their origins, syntax, and the context in which they are used.

### Module System

- require():
Belongs to the CommonJS (CJS) module system.
- Used in older Node.js projects and environments.
import:
- Belongs to the ES Modules (ESM) system.
Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and has gradually become the standard for JavaScript.

### Using `__dirname` in Node.js

------------

In this section, we looked at how to use `__dirname` in Node.js, even with ES modules in the newer versions (14 and later).

### What is `__dirname`?

------------------------

`__dirname` is a built-in global variable in Node.js that represents the directory name of the current module.

### Defining `__dirname` in ES Modules

--------------------------------------

In newer versions of Node.js, `__dirname` is not automatically defined when using ES modules. To define it, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
```

### Alternative Approach

-------------------------

Alternatively, you can use the `path.dirname()` function with the `import.meta.url` property to get the current directory:

```javascript
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

const currentDir = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
```

## Comparison

Both approaches achieve the same result, but the first approach using __dirname is generally considered cleaner and more readable. Additionally, the `__dirname` syntax is more concise and easier to write than the alternative approach.

## Conclusion

In summary, when using ES modules in Node.js, you need to define __dirname manually or use an alternative approach to get the current directory. The choice between the two approaches depends on your personal preference and the specific requirements of your project. And this is it.
